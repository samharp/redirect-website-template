# redirect-website-template

Collection of HTML files to show how to redirect from one site to another

## blank.html
For use when the browser window is meant to be blank (white) while the user is routed to another domain/webpage.

## basic-content.html
A rendition of `blank.html`, but includes basic text to directly show the user that they are being redirected.

## loading.html
A more polished version of the top two, fit with a loading spinner (can be swapped out for any kind of loading animation) and text to tell the user they are being redirected.

*Note:* CSS included within HTML document for ease of packaging (determining desired version). These styles can just as easily be moved to an external stylesheet.
